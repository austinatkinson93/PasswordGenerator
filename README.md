# PasswordGenerator

Hi! welcome to my Password Generator application, it should (Hopefully) create a random password based off of 4 parameters I have set, give it a try!

## installation
* Here is the link to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/austinatkinson93/bootstrap-portfolio)
* Have a look at my [Bootstrap portfolio](https://austinatkinson93.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio/)

## Usage
* To use the website simply click the "Generate Password" button and answer the prompts.
    - At least one parameter must be chosen to attain a password from the website

    ![Parameter Alert](images/P_alert.png)

    - your password length must also be between 8 and 128 characters, failing to do so will result in a prompt: 

    ![Length Alert](images/length_alert.png)


* Clicking the "Copy to Clipboard" button will add the button to your clipboard making it easy to paste into whatever page you may need to use it in.


Enjoy!
